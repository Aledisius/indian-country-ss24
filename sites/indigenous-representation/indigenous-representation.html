        <h1>Indigenous Representation In Videogames</h1>
            <h4><em>Alexander Sessions and DJ Kaur</em></h4>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
		    <hr> 
          <p>Indigenous representation in the media has proven to be both beneficial and detrimental to Indigenous communities. Historically, news media had a tendency to label Indigenous individuals as (noble) savages. Despite this, it is through the same news media that Indigenous communities can bring attention to their concerns, reaching a vast audience. In the realm of movies and television, Indigenous communities were frequently cast as antagonists in western films. However, contemporary portrayals are evolving, depicting many Indigenous characters in a more positive light, even though at times it may be relying on stereotypes. Yet, the question arises: how do video games, the newest addition in the media landscape, contribute to Indigenous representation, and through what other ways does it contribute to preservation? </p>

          <p>By looking at how Indigenous peoples are shown in individual mainstream games, you can chart a course in seeing how views have changed over the years, going from showing them as savage enemies to depicting them as actual living communities and people. You can also see how Indigenous developers have decided to use video games as a medium through which to tell stories from their own perspective, as well as a way of cultural preservation.</p>

	          <h3>The Mainstream Transition: Red Dead Redemption</h3>
        <hr>
          <p>Like other forms of media, video games made a transition from relying on stereotypes and prejudices in their depictions to instead show a far more human and realistic, if not entirely accurate, depiction of what (or rather who) Indigenous people are at their core. While this was a gradual trend that spanned multiple years and games, you can actually see the transition within two games of the same series: Red Dead Redemption (RD1), made in 2010,  and it’s sequal Red Dead Redemption 2 (RD2), which was made in 2018. In both games the player character is a white cowboy/frontiersman who’s had troubles with the law (John Marston in RD1 and Arthur Morgan in RD2), and in both games there is a single community of Indigenous people who interact with the player. </p>

            <p> The similarities end there, however, as in RD1, the Indigenous community is a violent gang made up of young men from various tribes that actively harasses the player and nearby communities. This gang is shown to wear feathers and war paint, and are eventually crushed by a player-aided US government raid, serving only as a group that the player must destroy (link). RD2, however, takes a very different approach, as the Indigenous community (the Wapiti tribe) here is depicted more sympathetically as refugees; victims of constant displacement by the US government. In RD2, the player actually assists the Wapiti in attempting to avoid removal, including stealing papers from an oil company trying to take Wapiti land, launching an attack on said company’s building, and stealing vaccines that were being held back by government representatives (link). These attempts result in eventual failure, but the tribe manages to survive by moving to Canada.</p>

          <p>In just the span of 8 years and two games, there is a clear transition between video games depicting Indigenous peoples as adversarial and savage, to depicting them as people with complexity and agency outside of being a simple enemy that must be defeated or overcome in order to advance. </p>
